The teaching style of the class is interesting with Prof. Downing calling on someone in class and basically having a conversation over the current topic.

While I'm a little disappointed we aren't using Django as our Python framework, Flask is cool because of how lightweight it is. I've read a lot about their differences but I've never really done a full fledged project in Flask aside from a small one in UTCS's Data Management (CS 347) where we built a web app comparing NoSQL databases. I hope during this class we learn the different philosophies of subversioning with a team and deploying. I've never used git with more than one other person before so having a 4-6 person team for the last 3 projects will be interesting. I've used git-flow which is a package for branching and subversioning with a team. I've also used P4V/Perforce which is a different subversioning tool.  
####  Tip of the Week
Use virtualenvs to manage your project environments. It will help prevent breaking projects with older packages when you upgrade them. It's also a good way to figure out the requirements for each project and keep a list. After setting up your virtualenv and pip installing packages you can:
Keep track of packages in requirements file  
`pip freeze > requirements.txt`  
Install packages in a new env  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
