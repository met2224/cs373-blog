title: Hello World

Note: I've decided to combine the blog post for the classes. I start with general comments over both classes since their both by Prof. Downing and then dive into more specific comments for classes.

First blog post for both classes. The teaching style of the class is interesting with Prof. Downing calling on someone in class and basically having a conversation over the current topic.

## CS 373  
While I'm a little disappointed we aren't using Django as our Python framework, Flask is cool because of how lightweight it is. I've read a lot about their differences but I've never really done a full fledged project in Flask aside from a small one in UTCS's Data Management (CS 347) where we built a web app comparing NoSQL databases. I hope during this class we learn the different philosophies of subversioning with a team and deploying. I've never used git with more than one other person before so having a 4-6 person team for the last 3 projects will be interesting. I've used git-flow which is a package for branching and subversioning with a team. I've also used P4V/Perforce which is a different subversioning tool.
####  Tip of the Week
Use virtualenvs to manage your project environments. It will help prevent breaking projects with older packages when you upgrade them. It's also a good way to figure out the requirements for each project and keep a list. After setting up your virtualenv and pip installing packages you can:
Keep track of packages in requirements file  
`pip freeze > requirements.txt`  
Install packages in a new env  
`pip install -r requirements.txt` 

## CS 371p
I've never worked with C++ and I remember the pain of C from 429 and 439 so I'm a little nervous. Planning on starting these projects early so I can knock out knowledge gaps/syntax errors with C++ sooner rather than later. The SWE class is right before this so the questions asked during class are reinforced. It was kind of interesting to see that the OOP class made the exact same mistakes as the SWE class over some of the finer details. One thing I disliked was when we had to talk about a segment of code and figure out what was wrong but only because it was the same in SWE. Made it felt like I couldn't say too much without giving the answer away.
#### Tip of the Week
CS 371p - If you are on OSX, use homebrew to manage as many packages/installations as possible. It makes life a lot easier :)
